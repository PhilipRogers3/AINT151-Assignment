<h1>Escape</h1>
<p>The Great hall was surprisingly empty, you thought it will be more heavily compact with more guards but there probably in the box you see next to the door 50 feet away. You walk towards the door slowly, even know you won’t get out by you want to create as little noise as you can so no guards will hear you walking around the great hall. If they hear you they will lock you in solitary confinement. You approach the door and you look to your right to check the guards box, there was a woman sleeping so you try to open the door silently so you don’t wake her but it was locked. Then you look around for the keys, you see them out of a corner of your eye. You reach for them. After a good 2 minutes of reaching your index finger to get the keys you finally can touch them so you slowly take with a beaming eye on the sleeping guard on the chair. You take the keys can you open the door. You ran out and you throw the keys in a river far far away from the Jail so when she wakes up she won’t have her eyes and it’s all her fought that You Escape. Well Done “<span id="playername"></span>” you are the true Rogue </p>
