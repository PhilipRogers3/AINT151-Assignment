<h1>Mapping</h1>
<p>You open the map with the same excitement a kid gets on christmas day opening this presents. You managed to pull off a smile however you donâ€™t want to make it to obvious that you got the map for the jail so you take it back in your cell and look at it more closely and you can whisper to yourself what will be a great plan to escape. After careful examination of the map you decided to go to the main hall and the door will lead to door to escape from.</p>
