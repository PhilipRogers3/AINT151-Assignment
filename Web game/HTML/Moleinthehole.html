<h1>Mole in the hole </h1>
<p>Itâ€™s so dark it like going someone turned all of your lights and you trying to find the lights. There is so much creepy crawlies like spiders, beetles, worms as well as leftovers from dinners which has been months ago. It sunk like a being in a bin of rotten food. Then after 20 minutes of endless crawling suddenly there was a light you got slightly faster after each crawl. You peek over the hole just like a meerkat peeking over looking for danger.</p>
