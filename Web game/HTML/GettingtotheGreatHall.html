<h1>Getting to the Great Hall</h1>
<p>You leave your cell possibly for the last time, you have no sad thoughts leaving it because you just want to get out of here. You walked past the pod boss trying not to draw attention to yourself, however the pod boss spots you in the corner of this eyes he comes towards you and you immediately stopped. As he walking you said “oh hi Mark, how you doing” he respond with“It’s pod boss and how do you know that name is Mark”, you replied surprisingly “Your name is actually Mark omg, I just guess” The pod boss responded with “anyway I’m good just cleaning up after dinner, <span id="playername"></span> do you wanna help”.</p>
