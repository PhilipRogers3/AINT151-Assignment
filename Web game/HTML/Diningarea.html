<h1>Dining Area</h1>
<p>You look around the dining area. There is still a lot of food on the floor from fellow inmates however you found a map on the floor under beneath a pile of food. You got to the map and it was the guard copy so one of them manage to drop it on the floor and how did no one pick it up already or it was be certain for me to get it </p>
