<p>It’s your first full day in Jail and you didn’t get any sleep due to noise and frightened whether you going to get beat up during the night. You woke up after the security guard said in a deep voice”Get your food for the day”. You try and get out of bed but your whole body is so limp it like carrying a dead body. 5 minutes you finally get out of bed. You walked towards where they will shipping food to the other inmates. When you got there your the last person to get it and everyone is looking at you and the guard said to you “_, Come on we don’t have all day”.You sit down somewhere there is free seats to not to sit next to anyone. There isn’t so you sit down anywhere, on your table an inmate on the table you sat on said confidently “What your name Junior” you replied nervously “_”  he/she replied “What are you in for_” you replied”.</p>
