<h1>Shop lifting</h1>
<p> My name is"<span id="playername"></span> and I steal from Tescos" They asked what did you steal from Tesco, you replied straight away with "alcohol because I had a addiction with alochol growing up". The pod boss come over and welcome you to the pod by saying “Hello, I’m the pod boss and I call the shots around here” you replied with a ok because you want to focus on escaping. You got a choice whether to look around your bed or the dining area for anything which can help you to escapee.</p>
