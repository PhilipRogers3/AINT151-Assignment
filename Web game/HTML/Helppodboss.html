<h1>Helping the Pod Boss</h1>
<p>You helped the pod boss clean up the dining area, you think if you help him he will be in this good books. It goes well some other inmates also helped, it was done in couple of minutes then the pod boss comes over to you shakes your hand and said “well done <span id="playername"></span>”. You respond “No Problem Mark...I mean Pod Boss lol” He walks away. You get onto what you were doing that getting to the Main hall. On the map there is a secret door leading to the Main hall for people without the map of the jail it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack impossible however with the map the door is the dining area, you went up to door still trying not to draw attention to yourself. You tried and open the door to see if it lock however it wasn’t locked some stupid guard didn’t lock it. You open the door.</p>
