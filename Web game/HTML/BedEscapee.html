<h1>Escape</h1>
<p>The Great hall was surprisingly empty, you thought it will be more heavily compact with more guards but there probably in the box you see next to the door 50 feet away. You walk towards the door slowly, even know you won’t get out by you want to create as little noise as you can so no guards will hear you walking around the great hall. If they hear you they will lock you in solitary confinement. You approach the door and you look to your right to check the guards box, there was a man sleeping so you try to open the door silently so you don’t wake her but it was locked. Then you look around for the keys, you see them out of a corner of your eye. You reach for them. The hamster who you killed pop up, you take a step back in shocked. Then he gets you the keys so you can escape. You open the door and you close the door, then you turn around to see the outside world. There the hamster waiting there with a Alphine Milk boxes to last a year. </p>
