<h1>Chicken</h1>
<p>What said a confused inmate. Then the leader said in a angry mood “come on” you constantly said no. In jail you never say no, it a sign of disrespect, so they beat you up viscously with all 5 members of the gang joining in then 1 minute later the guard come on and they stop attacking me. The guard ask the inmates in the pod what happen all of them said “i don’t know, nothing” other thing in jail is snitches get stitches so if you snitch on a inmate you will get beaten up for it. The guard take you away to get yourself clean up then he put you back in. You got a choice whether to look around your bed or the dining area for anything which can help you to escapee.</p>
