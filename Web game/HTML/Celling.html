<h1>Celling </h1>
<p>You return back to your bed. You search around your bed and around the pod. You found a hole under a bed. You move your bed to get enough round to go down the hole. You manage to move the bed with all your strength so you look around to make sure that where isn’t looking there isn’t you went down the hole. It’s so dark it like going someone turned all of your lights and you trying to find the lights. Then after 20 minutes of crawling there was a light you got slightly faster after each crawl. You peek over the hole just like a meerkat peeking over looking for danger. </p>
