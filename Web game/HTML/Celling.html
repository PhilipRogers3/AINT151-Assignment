<p>You return back to your bed. You search around your bed and around the pod. You found a hole under a bed. You move your bed to get enough round to go down the hole. You manage to move the bed with all your strength so you look around to make sure that there isn’t someone looking at you, there isn’t. You went down the hole. </p>
