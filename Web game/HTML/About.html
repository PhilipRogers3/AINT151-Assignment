<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Rogue is a story of a innocent man in jail escaping, this is a funny story with funny pictures and a hamster sub plot. The name Rogue comes from my name on various sites like discord and twitch, I been using the name Rogue since 10 years old when I got the Xbox 360 and been using it ever since and my surname is Rogers so its fits. I was doing a new spy story based on the film Johnny English but I changed to a escape from jail story because I can do an interesting story and I watch a lot of crime documentaries like 60 days in Jail so I know how jail's work and the ranking system in the pod like the pod boss. Things about me, I can play the piano. Started learning at 11, learnt it for 2 years when i took 3 years break because I didn't choose music as a option and then 2 years old I started learning again. I am in the big band which is a univeristy society. I am do play football a lot. My postion is a ST because I love scoring goals, I am a poacher striker because I am always in the box thinking where the ball will land and score, however I will contribute in passing to other teammates. The reason why I'm a striker is because my defending is not good enough and I'm pretty weak. I play for a team called Kroos Control, it a university futsal team which I play every Saturday. I support Chelsea Football club and I have been supporting them for 10 years now.  </p>
