<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Rogue is a story of a innocent man in jail escaping, this is a funny story with funny pictures and a hamster sub plot. The name Rogue comes from my name on various sites like discord and twitch, I been using the name Rogue since 10 years old when i got the Xbox 360 and been using it ever since. My surname is Rogers so its fits. I was doing a new spy story based on the film Johnny English but I changed to a escape from jail story because i can do an instersting story and I watch a lot of  crime documentaries like 60 days in Jail so I know how jail's work and the ranking system in the pod like the pod boss.</p>
