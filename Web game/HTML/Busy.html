<h1>You are Busy</h1>
<p>You respond “Sorry I busy” the pod boss was angry and make sure that you clean up tomorrow. “Yeah I definitely do it tomorrow” you responded. You went back to your cell waiting to the pod boss to finish cleaning up no one helped him, it felt like it took for hours. When he finish you was relive, you waited to the pod boss to leave so you get onto what you were doing that getting to the Main hall. On the map there is a secret door leading to the Main hall for people without the map of the jail it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack impossible however with the map the door is the dining area, you went up to door still trying not to draw attention to yourself. You tried and open the door to see if it lock however it wasn’t locked some stupid guard didn’t lock it. You open the door.</p>
